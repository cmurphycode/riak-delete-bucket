Riak does not provide a call to delete a bucket unless the bucket is empty. Although this is just like S3 and usually fine, it can be very useful to do this when you're testing.

Here's a little node script to delete all of the keys in a bucket. Use with caution; with great power comes great responsibility


Install npm:
    http://npmjs.org
    I found sudo to fail sometimes, but sudo su to root to work
    > sudo su
    > curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

Install riak-js lib
    npm install riak-js@latest
Set your riak IP and bucket, then fire away:
    node delete.js
